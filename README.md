### Hi, I'm Yuu ! ðŸ‘‹

  I'm a machine learning engineer with 1-2 years of experience in ML/DL. I'm interested in using ML/DL to solve real-world problems, such as improving healthcare,

I'm skilled in NLP and Vison. I've also contributed to the following open source projects:

* [Project 1]
* [Project 2]
* [Project 3]

  I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate with other talented people. If you're interested in working together, please contact me!
