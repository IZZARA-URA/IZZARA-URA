### Hi, I'm Yuu ! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a machine learning engineer with 1-2 years of experience in ML/DL. I'm interested in using ML/DL to solve real-world problems,

I'm skilled in NLP and Vison. I've also contributed to the following open source projects:

* [Project 1]
* [Project 2]
* [Project 3]

I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate with other talented people. If you're interested in working together, please don't hesitate to contact me!
